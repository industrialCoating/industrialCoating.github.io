      <h2>🤯 MYTH BUSTED: YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR!</h2>
      <p>No league. No fields. No full-time staff. No problem.</p>
      <p>Last weekend, one of our players who had never played organized sports before scored in a tournament against the <strong>#21 ranked team in Virginia</strong> at the SYC Virginian Cup. Like all the teams we play, they had elite trainers, custom kits, and top-flight turf fields with lights. We have fire in our hearts.</p>

      <h2>🤔 Everyone Thinks We’re Just a “Free Rec Program”</h2>
      <p>When people hear about 703 Warriors, they assume it’s charity soccer. Rec-level. Casual. “You get what you pay for.” Sounds too different to be serious, right?</p>
      <p>No home field. No league games. No gatekeeping. No paid staff. But here’s the truth: We’re not just building soccer players. We’re building <strong>teams that can scrap with the best</strong>, and kids that won’t back down from anything in life.</p>

      <h2>🔥 Our Secret Sauce</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Culture First:</strong> Our kids don’t just show up. They swear in. They grind. Every week, they hear: “Steal a rep. Don’t give up. It takes heart. Get better or go home.”</li>
        <li><strong>Simple, Scalable Structure:</strong> We train in 4–6 rotating stations per session. Volunteers run one station each using a documented playbook with diagrams. No coaching experience required—just commitment.</li>
        <li><strong>Smart Communication:</strong> WhatsApp keeps parents informed. ChatGPT bridges language gaps. We remove barriers, not create them.</li>
        <li><strong>Volunteer-Driven:</strong> No salaries. Just 3,000+ volunteer hours in 18 months, driven by community, love, and belief in the mission.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>💥 Real Change, On and Off the Field</h2>
      <p>One school counselor told us: <em>“Keep doing whatever you’re doing. This kid’s behavior is night and day from last year.”</em></p>
      <p>That’s the real win. And yet, the scoreboard tells a story too. We compete in <strong>7 tournaments annually</strong>. We beat top-tier clubs. And our kids proudly say, “That’s my team.” Something that they weren't able to say before.</p>

      <h2>🧠 Why This Works</h2>
      <p>We don’t have flash. We have <strong>structure, culture, and clarity</strong>.</p>
      <p>Our founder brings West Point discipline, Army Football grit, and a vision built to uplift kids left out by the system. We’re not mimicking the norm. We’re creating a blueprint for an alternative path that is just as viable as the others in the younger ages.</p>
      <p>No politics. No fluff. No pay-to-play. Just <strong>real work, real growth, and real outcomes.</strong></p>

      <h2>📍This Isn’t Just a Club. It’s a Movement.</h2>
      <p>703 Warriors was born in Northern Virginia, but this model can thrive anywhere parents are ready to step up and make a change. We’re ready to help others launch with structure, resources, support, and vision.</p>
