    <div class="blog-content">

      <p>It was 24 degrees.</p>
      <p>The fields were closed. The turf was buried. The lights were off.</p>
      <p>And we had 40 kids showing up anyways.</p>

      <p>That’s winter in the DMV. And that’s 703 Warriors.</p>

      <p>This winter has tested everyone. Snow. Ice. Frozen ground. Limited indoor space. Programs across the area pressed pause and understandably so.</p>

      <p>But our kids don’t get to pause life.</p>
      <p>So neither do we.</p>

      <h2>When the Doors Closed</h2>

      <p>We reached out to the county to use open gym slots when basketball wasn’t using them. No luck.</p>

      <p>We trained on an underutilized baseball turf field. The following night, the lights were turned off.</p>

      <p>We thought we might gain access to the beautiful grass field at Casa Chirilagua. Then, we learned it’s closed until May.</p>

      <p>Each time, the door didn’t just close. It locked!</p>
      <p>So we looked for another way in.</p>

      <h2>Partnership Matters</h2>

      <p>Our partnership with Casa Chirilagua has been critical. They opened their doors and gave us indoor space when options were scarce. It’s not massive or setup for sports activities. But, it’s available and availability matters.</p>

      <p>Still, a few small classrooms isn’t enough when you have multiple teams and kids who need to move.</p>

      <p>So we went outside.</p>

      <p>Not to a field.</p>
      <p>To the plaza.</p>

      <p>Headlamps on. Shovels scraping. Ice breaking. Parents helping. Kids laughing through visible breath in the cold air.</p>

      <p>We cleared space ourselves so we could rotate stations, some inside, some outside, just to keep the kids and the ball moving.</p>

      <p>No perfect setup. No ideal conditions. Just effort.</p>

      <h2>What We’re Really Teaching</h2>

      <p>We teach grit. Ownership. Creativity when resources are limited.</p>

      <p>But what does that actually mean?</p>

      <p>It means when someone says no, you don’t fold.</p>
      <p>It means when the lights go out, you adjust.</p>
      <p>It means when the field is closed, you build your own space.</p>

      <p>Here’s a truth our kids will learn eventually:</p>

      <p>The world does not automatically make space for you.</p>

      <p>Often, we’re asked to support other county and nonprofit programs for free. When we ask for help, we hear nothing back. That’s life. And our kids are watching how we respond to it.</p>

      <p>We could have said, "See you in March."</p>
      <p>Instead, we said, "Grab a shovel."</p>

      <p>We could have blamed the system.</p>
      <p>Instead, we modeled adaptability.</p>

      <p>We could have waited for better conditions.</p>
      <p>Instead, we created them.</p>

      <p>Because consistency is love.</p>

      <p>For many of our players, this is the most stable thing in their week. Wednesday. Thursday. Sunday. We’re there. Snow or not. Closed fields or not. Lights on or not.</p>

      <p>This isn’t just about soccer.</p>

      <p>It’s about showing a 9-year old what resilience looks like in real time.</p>

      <p>It’s about teaching that obstacles are not stop signs, they’re puzzles.</p>

      <p>It’s about proving that even when resources are tight and doors keep closing, you can still move forward.</p>

      <p><strong>Roadblocks? We go around them.</strong></p>

      <p>And whatever happens next, we’ll figure it out.</p>

      <p><strong>We don’t just teach it. We live it.</strong></p>
