    <h1 class="blog-title">We Aren't Your Traditional Soccer Club. DON'T BRING YOUR KID HERE ⚠️</h1>

    <div class="blog-content">
      <p>If you’re looking for a traditional soccer club, let us save you some time: <strong>don’t bring your kid here.</strong></p>
      <p>We aren’t in this for trophies, clout, or status. We’re not here to make you feel good about buying fancy gear or collecting participation medals.</p>
      <p>We are here to <strong>build kids that thrive on and off the field</strong> and we’ll do whatever it takes to get them there.</p>

      <h2>We Built Our Own System Because the Current One is Broken</h2>
      <p>Most clubs run the same tired playbook. We burned ours a long time ago.</p>
      <p>Our model is unorthodox, intentional, and built for real growth. Four programs. All connected. All focused on <strong>developing athletes and leaders</strong>, not just soccer players.</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Life Skills Training</strong> — Financial literacy, mentorship, online safety, peer pressure resistance. What other club teaches this? None that we’ve seen. Prove us wrong.</li>
        <li><strong>Street Soccer League</strong> — Organized pickup games. Minimal coaching. Maximum creativity. Kids learn how to play and not just how to follow instructions.</li>
        <li><strong>Community Fitness</strong> — Speed, strength, agility, footwork. Skills that private trainers charge for are taught for free every week.</li>
        <li><strong>Competitive Soccer</strong> — Earn your spot. No politics. No shortcuts. If you commit and put in the work, we’ll get you ready to compete at the next level.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>This Isn’t for Everyone — And That’s the Point</h2>
      <p>We practice on concrete, dirt, and grass. No lights? We bring our own. No fancy fields? Doesn’t matter. We train anywhere, anytime, with whoever shows up ready to work.</p>
      <p>Our pilot team didn’t come from elite travel programs. But in one year, they’ve gone from brand new to battling established clubs and winning.</p>
      <p>Imagine what we can do with more time, more kids, and more families who buy into this vision.</p>
      
      <h2>We’re Proudly Unorthodox</h2>
      <p>Here’s what makes us different (we’re not changing for anyone):</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Swearing-In Ceremony</strong>: Because joining 703 Warriors means something.</li>
        <li><strong>The Haka</strong>: Because passion and unity matter here.</li>
        <li><strong>Football-Inspired Coaching</strong>: We coach hard because we care.</li>
        <li><strong>Zero Tolerance for Entitlement or Disrespect</strong>: If that’s what you’re about, stay home.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>We develop <strong>teams, not rosters</strong>. We raise <strong>leaders, not followers</strong>. And we build <strong>grateful, tough, focused athletes</strong> who can succeed far beyond soccer.</p>
      
      <h2>Choose Your Path, But Choose Honestly</h2>
      <p>If you want real development, mental, physical, emotional, we’re here for you.</p>
      <p>If you want easy, good luck somewhere else.</p>
      <p>703 Warriors isn’t trying to fit in. We’re building something different. And different works if you do.</p>
